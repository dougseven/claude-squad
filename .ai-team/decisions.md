# Team Decisions

This file is the team's **constitution**. All agents must respect these 
decisions. No agent may override them without Coordinator approval.

---

## How to Use This File

- Decisions are added by the Coordinator after agent work completes
- Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] Decision Title`
- Each decision should be 1-3 sentences — what was decided and why
- When this file exceeds ~500 lines, run `/squad-prune`

## Decisions

<!-- Squad will populate this file as your team makes decisions. -->
<!-- Example format:

## [2025-01-15] API Authentication Strategy
Use JWT tokens with 24h expiry. Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies.
Decided by Lead after security review flagged localStorage risks.

## [2025-01-16] State Management
Use Zustand over Redux — simpler API, less boilerplate for this project size.
Frontend agent decision; approved by Lead.
